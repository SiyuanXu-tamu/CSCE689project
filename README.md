This Project is inspired by project website: https://github.com/taivu1998/FlapAI-Bird

Use 'train_agent.ipynb' to train the agent, you can choose SARSA, Q-learning or backward Q-learning. This code will save the results in file 'scores'
Then, 'plot.ipynb' is used to show the performance on tests.


The project requires the following frameworks:
    Pygame: https://www.pygame.org
    PyGame Learning Environment: https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment
    OpenAI Gym: https://gym.openai.com
    gym-ple: https://github.com/lusob/gym-ple
